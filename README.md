# Banana-identification
This program constructs a class to implement neural networks with both convolutional layers and fully connected layers. It then trains a convolutional neural network to distinguish images of bananas from randomly generated images which are statistically similar to bananas. This neural network performs perfectly (304/304 correct predictions on the testing set) for types of images which are similar to (but distinct from) those used in its training. 

## Neural network class
The file Neural_Network_Class contains an implementation of neural networks with both partially and fully connected layers, including convolutional layers. To accomplish this each neural networks has a list of weight matrices (containing the weights and biases for each layer), as well as a list of "connection matrices".  A connection matrix must be the same size as the weight matrix for its layer, but its entries are all ones and zeros, indicating which inputs are connected to which outputs. For a fully connected layer all the entries in its connection matrix are 1.0.

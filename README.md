# Banana-identification
This program constructs a class to implement neural networks with both convolutional layers and fully connected layers. It then trains a convolutional neural network to distinguish images of bananas from randomly generated images which are statistically similar to bananas. This neural network performs perfectly (304/304 correct predictions on the testing set) for types of images which are similar to (but distinct from) those used in its training. Its performance on new types of images is mixed, but better than random.
